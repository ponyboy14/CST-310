# CST-310

This is an OpenGL project done by Lucas Lasecla and Sammie Vaicius

To run this program you must have:
    g++
    glfw
    glad

*NOTE* - Glad does not need to be installed, source code imported and included in the project 

Once those libraries are installed, in the terminal you will compile the program with the following command:
    g++ lighting.cpp glad.c khrplatform.h -o lighting -lglfw

After the program is compiled, you can run it with the following command:
    ./lighting


To end the program, simply close the window
